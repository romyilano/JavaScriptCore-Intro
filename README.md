# Business Advantages

* Less bad UI than hybrid cross-platform html5 apps based on the webview
* Utilize team's javascript code for the drearier tasks like: networking, json parsing, json encoding, anything to do with json.. ;) 
* Don't have to get locked into a proprietary cross-platform tool - you can shop around, pick and choose with your classes
